# Algorithmic Trading Execution

This repository contains functionality for interfacing with the crypto.com API to place orders.
Why crypto - it allows easier access to intraday data when devising strategies.

Note:
- This repo is WIP for algo execution.
- For automated systematic trading ideas and strategies, including entry and exit signals, see my repo: https://github.com/JoeRRPhillips/trading

For security reasons, much initial development is shielded from git.
